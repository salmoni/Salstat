# Salstat – Roadmap

## Introduction

This document describes and the things that it doesn't have but needs and the things that Salstat has and needs fixed.

### Required features

* wx.Config – used for configuration rather than the .salstatrc file
* Firm up charts – more testing is needed for these along with use cases
* Variables view – changes here should affect the data view
* File format – Save to SQLite database by default rather than CSV
* Read and write SPSS format files (very tricky but possible)
* Undo feature for the output and data and variable grids
* Give each variable (column) a unique index for referencing across the program
